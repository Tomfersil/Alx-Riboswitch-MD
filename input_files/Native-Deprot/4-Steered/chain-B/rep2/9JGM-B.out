Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.406 nm

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 310 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.117 nm, buffer size 0.117 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.050 nm, buffer size 0.050 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
